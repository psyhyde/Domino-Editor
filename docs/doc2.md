title: Text Block & Text Styling
---

A **Text Block** is the most used and most common block in a **BSE**. Its styling rules largely inherent from common **WYSIWYG Markdown Editors**. 

**Inline** and **Block** are actually HTML concepts for **inline elements** and **block elements** [^[W3School]^](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp).  Here, we take the concept to UX/UI level, emphasizing on their visual and interaction properties.   

## Inline Text Style

We expect most below Styles/Effects can stack upon each other, like **Bold** + *Italic* + <u>Underline</u> + ~~Strikethrough~~ = <u>***~~Stacked Style~~***</u>

There are some exceptions,  like `Inline code` + ==Highlight== 

### 1. Bold

### 2. Italic

### 3. Underline

### 4. Strikethrough

### 5. Highlight

### 6. Inline Code

### 7. Tag / Keyword ‚≠êÔ∏è

Has similarity with **Inline Code** on visual level, but different on use case level. 

A further implementation would be adding a **Popover Card** on the **Keyword UI**.

### 8. Superscript & Subscript

### 9. Text Alignment

Not a Markdown supported style, but indeed a feature needed by many.

## Legacy Inline Text Style

Below are legacy **Office Styling Features** that I am trying to Kill üó°ü©∏, with a **Universal Theme Switcher**.

In a modern web editing environment, these attributes are not supposed to be seem by users. 

### x.1. Font Color

### x.2. Font Background Color

### x.3. Font Family

### x.4. Font Size

### x.5. Letter-Spacing & Word Spacing

![wordCharacterspacing](../static/assets1/wordCharacterspacing.png)

Word Spacing is not supported in CJK font

### x.6. Line Height & Paragraph Spacing

**Paragraph Spacing** is actually a design term, appearing in InDesign, Sketch, MS Word, etc.

In CSS,  `margin-bottom` is used to add spacing in-between paragraphs. There are many alternative ways to achieve this, depending on the dev-framework you use.

### x.7. Indent

### x.8. Content Width / Line Width

### x.9. Inline Image

### x.10. Text-Image Wrapping

Another **Legacy Style** appears in Office product, graphic publications, and newspaper.

## Inline Function
